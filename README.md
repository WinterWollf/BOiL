# README

## Project Description
This project is carried out as part of the **Operational Research and Logistics** course. The main goal is to develop an application to solve problems using the **Critical Path Method (CPM)** and the **Broker Problem**. The implementation is done in **Python**.

## Projects

### 1. Critical Path Method (CPM)
CPM is a project planning and management technique. Our application will calculate:
- Earliest start and finish times for tasks,
- Latest start and finish times for tasks,
- The critical path of the project,
- Time reserves for individual tasks,
- Visualization of results (e.g., graph, Gantt chart).

**Features:** (to be specified later)
- Input data entry capability,
- Graphical representation of results (dependency graph, table, Gantt chart).

### 2. Broker Problem (to be specified later)
This project will focus on optimizing transportation in a supplier-customer system. The application will calculate:
- Total cost,
- Total revenue,
- Brokerâ€™s profit,
- Table of unit profits and optimal transports.

**Features:** (to be specified later)

## Technologies (to be specified later)
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** (to be determined during development)
- **Interface:** Desktop
